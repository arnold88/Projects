Summary:

Both POMDP files are run under a file/print server with two Intel Xeon E5504 2.5GHz processor with 20 GB of RAM. 

The original POMDP supplied by the POMDP.org site cause an abort/crash on the solver after 25 minutes and 12 epochs (iterations). The modified POMDP file runs about an hour (with 688 epochs) before a force abort due to people complaining about severe degradtion of server performance.

<p>Formations in football are a method of positioning players on the 
pitch to allow a team to play according to their pre-set tactics. 
Different formations can be used depending on whether a team wishes to 
play more attacking or defensive football. Usually if the team has the 
ball more in a game and they have already scored more than once they 
just keep the ball and not risk taking passes that will give the ball 
away. Formations can be altered during a game, but this requires 
adaptation by the players to fit in to the new system.</p>
<p>Formations count the number of players in each area, beginning with 
the defensive line (not including the goalkeeper). It is by convention 
counted when the team is defending and being properly organised. The 
most common formations are variations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_%28football%29#4.E2.80.934.E2.80.932" title="Formation (football)" class="mw-redirect">4-4-2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_%28football%29#4.E2.80.933.E2.80.933" title="Formation (football)" class="mw-redirect">4-3-3</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_%28football%29#4.E2.80.932.E2.80.933.E2.80.931" title="Formation (football)" class="mw-redirect">4-2-3-1</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_%28football%29#3.E2.80.935.E2.80.932" title="Formation (football)" class="mw-redirect">3-5-2</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_%28football%29#4.E2.80.932.E2.80.932.E2.80.932" title="Formation (football)" class="mw-redirect">4-2-2-2</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Association football used to have formations with more attackers, but
 gradually formations have been shifted towards increased defensive 
security. Old formations included the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-3-5" title="2-3-5" class="mw-redirect">2-3-5</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2-2-6&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="2-2-6 (page does not exist)">2-2-6</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-2-4" title="4-2-4" class="mw-redirect">4-2-4</a>.</p>

The Counter-attack</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The aim of this type of football is to catch the opponent on the 
"break". When they give away possession in midfield or attack, opposing 
players will tend to be further up the field than usual and may not be 
able to quickly adjust to a defensive mindset. Counter-attacking 
football may involve leaving one or two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striker" title="Striker" class="mw-redirect">strikers</a>
 near the half-way line in the hope that a through ball can be played to
 catch the opponent off guard. This parallels the long through ball 
tactic explained below. In the example, an attack by the black team has 
broken down and ended up in the hands of the white goalie. By kicking a 
long through ball for the furthermost white player (left up there in the
 hope of this situation - this is the "break" mentioned above), the 
player has a chance of scoring as he should have evaded the defence if 
he is fast enough.</p>
<p>In other cases, defenders and midfielders may join in the 
counter-attack, trying to outnumber or otherwise overtake the opposition
 by quick and intelligent movement and fast passes. Speed is an 
important factor both in offence and defence, as the probability of 
scoring decreases sharply when the opponent has managed to organise 
their defence. This type of game was displayed well by the quick, 
counter-attacking play of Germany in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Possession football">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Possession_football">Possession football</span></h3>
<p>Teams that aim to retain control of the ball over longer periods of time, in the process making a large percentage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_%28association_football%29" title="Passing (association football)">passes</a> that give low risk of losing the ball, are said to play <b>possession football</b>.
 Utilizing this tactic demands players skillful in ball control and 
precise passing. If successful, it will tire opposing players because 
they have to run and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_%28football_move%29#Association_football" title="Tackle (football move)">tackle</a> more. A style of possession football originating from Spain is <i>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiki-taka" title="Tiki-taka">tiki-taka</a>"</i>,
 where a large number of primarily short passes are deployed by multiple
 players of the team before culminating in a definitive strike on the 
opposing team's goal. It was effectively employed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2008" title="UEFA Euro 2008">UEFA Euro 2008</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup" title="2010 FIFA World Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a> champions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team" title="Spain national football team">Spain</a>, managed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Aragon%C3%A9s" title="Luis Aragonés">Luis Aragonés</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_del_Bosque" title="Vicente del Bosque">Vicente del Bosque</a> respectively, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sextuple" title="The Sextuple" class="mw-redirect">sextuple</a>-winning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_FC_Barcelona_season" title="2008–09 FC Barcelona season">2008-09</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona" title="FC Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> side managed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Guardiola" title="Josep Guardiola">Josep Guardiola</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Direct football">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Direct_football">Direct football</span></h3>
<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_ball_%28association_football%29" title="Long ball (association football)" class="mw-redirect">Long ball (association football)</a></div>
<p>More often associated with counter-attacking football than with 
possession football, direct football means that players spend little 
time with the ball before passing. In order to achieve this, each player
 frequently uses only one or two touches. The direct attack is sometimes
 associated with the long-ball style. Long ball is the term used in 
association football to describe an attempt, often speculative, to 
distribute the ball a long distance down the field via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_%28football%29" title="Cross (football)">cross</a>,
 without the intention to pass it to the feet of the receiving player. 
It is a technique that can be especially effective for a team with a 
tall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striker" title="Striker" class="mw-redirect">striker</a> to get in the box.</p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Substitutions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Substitutions">Substitutions</span></h2>
<p>In competitive 11-a-side matches, teams are allowed to bring on up to
 three substitutes. The rules of the competition must state the maximum 
number of players allowed to be named as a substitute, which may be 
anywhere between three and seven. In non-competitive matches, the use of
 substitutes must be determined before the match begins, except in 
friendly international matches, where no more than six substitutes may 
be brought on.</p>
<p>The most tired players are generally substituted, but only if their 
substitutes are well trained to fill in the same role, or if the 
formation is transformed at the same time to accommodate for the 
substitution.</p>
<p>Coaches often refrain from substituting defensive players in order 
not to disrupt the defensive posture of the team. Instead, they often 
replace ineffective attackers or unimaginative midfielders in order to 
freshen up the attacking posture and increase their chances of scoring.</p>
<p>For a team that is losing a game, a fresh striker can bring more 
benefit in circumventing an opposed defence line composed of relatively 
tired players. For a team that is winning a game, a fresh midfielder or a
 defender can bring more benefit in strengthening the defence against 
the opposition's attackers (who may be fresh substitutes themselves). In
 this situation, it is usually imaginative attacking flair players who 
are replaced by tough-tackling defensive midfielders or defenders.</p>
<p>Injured players may also need to be substituted. For each injured 
player who must be substituted, the team loses one more opportunity to 
influence things later in the game in their favour.</p>
<p>Substitutions can also be used as a time consuming tactic to hold a one goal lead in the last minutes.</p>

As the last line of defence, goalkeepers must be able to make quick, athletic saves. Here, the skill of England's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Banks" title="Gordon Banks">Gordon Banks</a> robs Brazil's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pele" title="Pele" class="mw-redirect">Pele</a> of a good scoring opportunity in their legendary confrontation.

<p>The importance of a skill depends much on the player's position on 
the field. Overall, football skills can be divided into four main areas,
 namely outfield technical, mental, physical and goalkeeping technical 
abilities.</p>

<p>Width and depth are both principles of offence and defence as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Width in attack-</i> Mainly using wingers often gaps are made between defenders using the width.</li>
</ul>
<p>These gaps can be used to feed the ball to strikers.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Width in defence-</i> the defender tries to contract and deny width and space</li>
<li><i>Depth in attack-</i> the attacker uses depth by moving men up 
from the rear, but may use a constant "target striker" or front man to 
always be present deep in the defence.</li>
<li><i>Depth in defence-</i> the defender also uses depth by marking 
supporting players in the opposing team, therefore the player with the 
ball won't have anyone to pass to, but may abandon depth temporarily to 
set an offside trap.</li>
<li><i>Balance in defence.</i> The defence attempts balanced coverage of
 vulnerable space. Players do not simply cluster on the right side for 
example, just because the ball is there at the moment.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>'<b>Pass and move'</b>: This is the most basic team tactic — as soon
 as the ball has come into possession of the player, they need to be 
quick to decide whether to pass it or not. If they don't pass it 
immediately, they need to move with it; if they do pass it, they again 
need to move along, following the general ball movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can also be used to mean that once a player has passed the ball 
he does not remain stationary but moves into a position where he can 
receive the ball again and give more options to the player in 
possession.</p>
<ul>
<li>'<b>Give and go'</b>[or '<b>combination passing'</b>]: This is a 
basic tactic which is essentially the same as 'pass and move', and is an
 essential part of the 'target man' style of play (see below). The 
player in possession of the ball plays a pass to a teammate and then 
immediately seeks to move into space. If the player who passed the ball 
can 'lose' his defensive marker (either through pace, movement, superior
 fitness or a lack of awareness on the part of the defender) he could 
then be free to receive a return pass and advance towards and possibly 
threaten the goal. When the ball is played by the receiving player 
immediately back to the first player this is known as a 'One-Two' (in 
British parlance)</li>

Switching sides</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><b>Switching the attack</b>: Using a 'square' or 'cross' pass across
 the whole width of the pitch to a player in plenty of space is a very 
effective way of both relieving pressure and building a fresh attack. 
The defending team will be required to adjust its positions and this 
usually creates spaces which can be exploited. In this example, the 
player numbered 1 has moved out of position, allowing more space for the
 opposing player. By playing the ball to the other side (the curved line
 represents an aerial pass), the recipient of the pass finds themselves 
in space which can be exploited.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The 'through ball': Using the space behind the opponent's defensive line</b>: Passes into this area have a number of pros: If an attacking player reaches the pass, taking care to avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_%28association_football%29" title="Offside (association football)">offside</a>,
 he may get a 1-on-1 challenge with the goalkeeper, or be in an 
excellent position for a flank attack. Even if a defender reaches the 
pass first, the outcome could still be good for the attacking team. The 
defender will face his own goal, which could prompt him to give away a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_kick" title="Corner kick">corner kick</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throw-in" title="Throw-in">throw-in</a>, make a risky pass to his team's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_%28association_football%29" title="Goalkeeper (association football)">goalkeeper</a>, or being put under heavy pressure near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_flag" title="Corner flag" class="mw-redirect">corner flag</a>.
 Typically, teams with faster attackers than the opponent's defenders 
will try challenging this space, while the defending team in these cases
 will want to keep their defenders low when defending in order to give 
away as little space as possible between the defenders and the 
goalkeeper.</li>

The long through ball</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The <b>long through ball</b>: This is a long, and usually high, pass
 from a teams' own half, over the heads of the other team's defence. It 
is intended for the attacking players to chase and it is important that 
they remain in an onside position until the ball is kicked. The tactic 
works best with strong and fast forwards who will have a good chance of 
winning back the ball, taking control over it, and eventually getting a 
shot on goal. In the diagram, the ball (red line) is played in front of 
the furthermost forward, the dotted blue line showing their run. In this
 example, a through-ball pass along the ground would be picked up by one
 of the defenders (black team) because the gap between the two central 
defenders is too small.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Using the space between the opponent's defensive line and midfielder line ('the hole')</b>:
 A common build-up of attacks is to pass the ball into the space between
 the opponent's defenders and midfielders. Normally, an attacker with 
his back to the goal will receive the pass. He will seek to turn with 
the ball, or distribute it to a player facing the goal, who optimally 
also is in front of the opponent's midfielders - or even on the move 
into the space behind the opponent's defenders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Triangular movement</b>: This is a movement tactic that allows a 
safe and quick shifting of the offensive flanks while maintaining 
control of the ball. In a triangular play the ball is passed between 
three players to form a triangle. The triangle is then shifted to a 
different position when a new player is added. Many triangles can be 
created with various combinations of players with the intention of 
slowly moving the ball forward and never really compromising possession.
 This tactic works well when trying to gain control in the midfield. 
However, it can also be used for pure attacking purposes. The 
effectiveness of this tactic lies in the fact that defenders are unable 
to quickly 'adapt' to the other attacker's style of play.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Swapping of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder#Winger" title="Midfielder">wing men</a></b>:
 Sometimes, a team with two flexible (position wise) wide men will allow
 them to interchange as the game progresses. The aim of this is to 
confuse the defenders who are assigned to mark them, thus maybe leading 
to opportunities as the defender tries to find their man in set pieces 
(corners, free kicks etc., where the man may be in a totally different 
position and thus evade his grasp). Also, if the wingers are different 
types of player (one favouring crossing from deep positions whilst the 
other is prone to trying to dribble past their marker for example), then
 it might be to exploit a weakness in the opposing defender.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Side Overloads</b>: An offensive attack can pressure the 
defense on to one side of the pitch by running most of its attackers and
 midfielders to one side letting a wing player or defender come to the 
opposite side with little or no coverage. The ball is then crossed or 
passed to that unmarked player for a free or near free shot.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Using a target man</b>: This tactic is useful when the team 
possesses a quality striker who has the ability of taking on the whole 
defence on his own. He will usually occupy two defenders, thus making 
the defence more vulnerable. Combined with two fast wingers, this tactic
 may give the 4-man defence potential problems. The team may also 
benefit from a target man at set pieces. The target man, can use give/go
 tactics described earlier, can attempt to "knock down" high passes to 
teammates or can simply try to outpower and outmuscle opposition 
defenders to create scoring opportunities for himself. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer" title="Alan Shearer">Alan Shearer</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Ferguson" title="Duncan Ferguson">Duncan Ferguson</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sutton" title="Chris Sutton">Chris Sutton</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Adebayor" title="Emmanuel Adebayor">Emmanuel Adebayor</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Toni" title="Luca Toni">Luca Toni</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile_Heskey" title="Emile Heskey">Emile Heskey</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Koller" title="Jan Koller">Jan Koller</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_%C5%BDigi%C4%87" title="Nikola Žigić">Nikola Žigić</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatan_Ibrahimovic" title="Zlatan Ibrahimovic" class="mw-redirect">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Crouch" title="Peter Crouch">Peter Crouch</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Drogba" title="Didier Drogba">Didier Drogba</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_Klose" title="Miroslav Klose">Miroslav Klose</a> are all examples of strikers adept at playing this role.</li>

<b>Free kick trickery at work - 1970 - Brasil vs Czechoslovakia:</b>

<p>Free kicks and dead-ball restarts come into play following a foul or 
other infractions. Indirect free kicks must be touched by another player
 before any shot is taken. Direct free kicks can be made directly on 
goal. Offensive players attempt numerous tricks to beat the defenders, 
who often form a solid wall of players directly in front of the goal. 
Attackers may attempt to blast the ball through the defensive wall, or 
curl it over or around using spin. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juninho" title="Juninho">Juninho</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Pirlo" title="Andrea Pirlo">Andrea Pirlo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carlos_%28footballer%29" title="Roberto Carlos (footballer)">Roberto Carlos</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Del_Piero" title="Alessandro Del Piero">Alessandro Del Piero</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Sneijder" title="Wesley Sneijder">Wesley Sneijder</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronaldinho" title="Ronaldinho">Ronaldinho</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo" title="Cristiano Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Hardie" title="Martin Hardie">Martin Hardie</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rog%C3%A9rio_Ceni" title="Rogério Ceni">Rogério Ceni</a> are considered<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words" class="mw-redirect"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. from March 2011">by whom?</span></a></i>]</sup> some of the best in the business.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from March 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></p>

<p>How throw-ins are best handled depends on where it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>In one's own half the aim of a throw-in may be to retain possession 
in order to build up the next attack. The throw may not go forward, and 
the most unmarked player may be a full-back who is behind the ball. Such
 a throw followed by a quickly taken 'switch' pass could be an effective
 tactic. Under pressure, however, the ball is often thrown up the line 
to gain as much ground as possible.</li>
<li>If the thrower is unmarked a simple tactic is to take a short throw 
to the feet or chest of a marked player who immediately returns the ball
 to the thrower.</li>
<li>In the last third of the pitch a player with a long throw can put 
pressure onto the defenders by throwing the ball deep into the penalty 
area, resulting in somewhat similar tactics to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_kick" title="Corner kick">corner kick</a> situation, but with the added advantage of avoiding the offside trap, as an attacking player cannot be offside from a throw in.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18" title="Edit section: Goal kicks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Goal_kicks">Goal kicks</span></h4>
<p>A goal kick is an important 'set piece' that will occur many times in
 a game and yet few teams practice it. If taken quickly the kick may be 
taken short to a full-back who has run into a wide position. Although 
this may gain little ground it retains the all-important possession of 
the ball. A longer kick to the midfield is more common and it is vital 
that the midfield unit are in a position to receive it. It is the only 
set piece that can be taken whilst the ball is moving.</p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19" title="Edit section: Corners">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Corners">Corners</span></h4>
<p>A corner is a real goal scoring opportunity and it is essential to 
know who is the best at taking a good corner from both the left and 
right side of the pitch. A good corner will be aimed high across the 
goal and may be 'bent' towards or away from the goal. At least one of 
the forwards should be on or close to the goal line when the kick is 
taken.</p>
<p>Another tactic on a corner is to let the best shooter stay in the 
back "trash" position and have the defence worried about those up front.
 The player taking the corner kick makes a small pass back to the trash 
shooter who has time and space to take a good shot.</p>

Defenders need to cooperate closely to cope with fast moving attackers. 
Here, one of the tightest defences in World Cup history, Uruguay 1970, 
is broken by a rapid three-man combination move: Jairzinho - Pelé - 
Tostão. The final defender, Matosas of Uruguay has no support as 
Jairzinho makes his final sprint.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>All eleven players on the pitch have a defensive role. Which roles 
they are assigned, depends on tactics. In principle, there are two ways 
of defending, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_defence" title="Zone defence" class="mw-redirect">zone defence</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Man-to-man_defence&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Man-to-man defence (page does not exist)">man-to-man defence</a>.
 In a zone defence, defensive players mainly move in relation to each 
other, whereas a man-to-man defence mainly moves in relation to opposing
 players. Whenever defensive players are given, or give themselves, a 
larger degree of freedom, hybrids of the two are seen.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21" title="Edit section: First, second and third defender">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="First.2C_second_and_third_defender">First, second and third defender</span></h4>
<p>The <b>first defender</b> has the main responsibility for what the 
opponent in possession does, seeking to obstruct dangerous passes. The 
first seconds after the team has lost the ball are important, as the 
defending team in these seconds will be poorly organised defensively. 
Wise first defending will contribute to the defending team managing to 
organise before the opponents may attack.</p>
<p>The first defender should usually be the player closest to the 
opponent holding possession, but needs to be at the defending side of 
him in order to do an effective job. He should keep a distance of about 2
 metres, although the ideal distance will vary with each situation. The 
point is to pressure the opponent as much as possible without giving him
 a large possibility of a dribble. As a dribble isn't as dangerous when 
the defending team is well organised, the distance may be shorter in 
these cases. Analogously, the distance should be increased if the 
defence is poorly organised.</p>
<p>In certain cases, the first defender should attempt a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_tackle" title="Sliding tackle">tackle</a>. Often, however, this will increase the probability of being dribbled and passed.</p>
<p>The direction in which to move towards the opponent with possession 
of the ball may be the shortest direction. However, it may be of value 
to curve the defensive run, in order to channel the opponent in a 
certain direction. If the defensive team is well organised, he should be
 channeled towards the centre of the pitch. In the case of temporarily 
poor defensive organisation, however, he should be channeled towards the
 line.</p>
<p>The <b>second defender</b> is for security if the first defender is passed. In that case, he takes over as first defender, and ideally one of the <b>third defender</b>s
 takes over as second defender. The team should be organised in a manner
 to make this transition as fast as possible. The typical ideal distance
 between the second and first defender is about six metres, but this 
will vary strongly from situation to situation. The most important 
factor is the opponent's speed. If he's moving fast, the distance should
 be longer. If he's standing still, the second and first defender may in
 some cases join forces and work as two first defenders.</p>
<p>The job of the <b>third defender</b> is to provide deep cover. He is 
generally in a stand-off position relative to the first and second 
defenders and tries to view the "big picture", keeping watch for new 
opponents moving up, and covering vulnerable gaps if the first and 
second defenders are bypassed. The <i>sweeper</i> role is sometimes 
conceived as that of a third defender, but every defensive player not 
immediately engaging the ball has the obligation to adjust his 
positioning to guard against dangerous situations and to plug vulnerable
 gaps. While the role of first and second defenders are rather similar, 
the third defenders' role is very different in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_defence" title="Zone defence" class="mw-redirect">zone defence</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Man-to-man_defence&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Man-to-man defence (page does not exist)">man-to-man defence</a>.

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_defence" title="Zone defence" class="mw-redirect">zone defence</a>,
 second and third defenders and midfielders are organised in two lines, 
in the transverse direction of the field, thus organising a <b>defender line</b> and a <b>midfielder line</b>,
 the midfielder line working as an "outer shield" for the defenders. The
 lines should be as straight as possible, although the first defender 
and in some cases the second defender may rush out of it to pressure the
 opponent with the ball. A straight line of defenders may prevent spaces
 behind some of them due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_%28association_football%29" title="Offside (association football)">offside</a> rule. Also, even in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_defence" title="Zone defence" class="mw-redirect">zone defence</a>, some opponents, for example those moving into dangerous space, may temporarily need to be marked. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Man-to-man_defence&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Man-to-man defence (page does not exist)">man-to-man defence</a> ideology holds that almost <i>all</i> opponents need to be marked at all times, although they will have to keep an eye on zone considerations as well, and usually a <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweeper_%28football%29" title="Sweeper (football)" class="mw-redirect">sweeper</a></b> will be given a free defensive role. In practice, however, every defence will be a mix of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_defence" title="Zone defence" class="mw-redirect">zone defence</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Man-to-man_defence&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Man-to-man defence (page does not exist)">man-to-man defence</a>, although often with heavy leanings towards one or the other.</p>
<p>The number of players in the defender and midfielder lines is given by the number of football <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_%28football%29" title="Formation (football)" class="mw-redirect">formations</a>.
 Some formations use midfield anchors to stop attacks between the two 
lines. Attackers usually also play a role in pressurising defenders, in 
order to give them less time to find good passing alternatives.</p>
<p>The lines should be shifted sideways depending where the ball is. The
 third defenders should keep a sensible distance to each other, 
depending on the width the opponent's attacking players are distributed 
in.</p>

<p>Each player in defence and defensive midfield has a zone of the pitch
 to protect. When the opposition attacks, where ever the other team 
drive the ball in attack,the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweeper_%28football%29" title="Sweeper (football)" class="mw-redirect">sweeper</a> doubles up with the man who is protecting that certain area. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweeper_%28football%29" title="Sweeper (football)" class="mw-redirect">sweeper</a> is usually a decent enough centre back who has lots of energy.</p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24" title="Edit section: Depth considerations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Depth_considerations">Depth considerations</span></h4>
<p>The distance between the defender line and the midfielder line should
 be kept constant at about 15 metres. However, the defensive line should
 back up and thus increase this distance, <i>stand off</i>, when there 
is no pressure on the opponent in possession, as this increases the 
possibility of a through ball. With tough pressure on the opponent, the 
distance may be reduced to below 15 metres. Also, as opponents move in 
close to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area" title="Penalty area">penalty area</a>, the defending team will be forced to move their midfielders ever closer to their defenders.</p>
<p>When organised, the defending team will offer no resistance until the
 attacking team has advanced to a certain height on the pitch. The <b>pressure height</b>,
 or at which depth the midfielders should start acting as first and 
second defenders, depends on a lot of factors. For example, as higher 
pressure is more tiring, it demands players with good stamina. In 
general, a defensive-minded team will tend to stay lower, thus 
diminishing defensive risks as opponents get less space. This however, 
also gives them a longer way to the goal in the event of a break and 
counter-attack, making the long through ball a typical alternative.</p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25" title="Edit section: The man-to-man defence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_man-to-man_defence">The man-to-man defence</span></h4>

 system, a single defender follows his opponent wherever he goes. 
Extremely tight marking can be achieved in this way and star players can
 often be neutralised in a game by use of a dedicated "shadow". Since 
the man to man defence will take defenders in any part of the field, 
interceptions and broken plays will often offer opportunity for quick 
counter-attack. The Italian teams of the 1970s and 1980s often used this
 approach with impressive results.</p>
<p>The weakness of the man to man defence is depth when fresh attackers 
move up. The man to man defence also allows defenders to be drawn out of
 position, opening gaps for other attackers in vulnerable areas. This 
was Italy's fatal weakness in the 1970 Final, according to some 
analysts.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
 To overcome this problem with depth, the man to man defence may use a 
'sweeper', who is a central defender and has a free role, <i>i.e.</i> 
has not been assigned a player to mark. He sometimes takes up a position
 slightly behind the other defenders, as his defensive role often is to 
'sweep up' any attacks that break through the defence and as such he 
adds valuable depth to the defensive unit. Usually the sweeper will be 
the controller of the defence. They will determine where the back line 
should be at any given time. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_defence" title="Zone defence" class="mw-redirect">Zone defence</a> does not require a sweeper role, and as many teams have changed their tactics to this, sweepers are today rare.</p>

<p>At free-kicks from short range, a wall of defensive players is lined 
up. How many players should participate in the wall will depend on the 
angle and distance from the goal, and on the opponent's assumed shooting
 skills. The wall usually covers one end of the goal. The goalkeeper 
will be positioned nearer the other end of the goal, both because he 
then can see the ball when it's shot, and because it is more difficult 
for attackers to hit a powerful shot on target at the end that the wall 
covers.</p>

 most teams use man-on-man marking, even those which otherwise play zone
 defence. Each player is given an opponent to mark, in advanced football
 they usually have been assigned an opponent before the match. 
Substituting at the time of a defensive set piece is regarded as unwise,
 as play may be started before the substitute has come into marking 
position.</p>
<p>A few teams use the tactic of gathering defenders on one line on 
corner kicks and similar situations, in effect giving them the 
responsibility for zones instead of particular opponents.</p>

<p>In the case of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick" title="Penalty kick">penalty kick</a>, no defending players except the goalkeeper are allowed within the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area" title="Penalty area">penalty area</a>
 or within ten yards of the penalty spot. A significant number of 
players should, however, be placed right outside the penalty area, alert
 to advance into the area and clear any deflection. For this purpose, 
sometimes the attacking team will nominate two players to run at the 
goal from either side of the penalty spot; timing their run so that they
 only enter the penalty area once the kick has been taken will hopefully
 give them the first opportunity at gathering the ball if it is saved by
 the goalkeeper. This tactic is rarely seen, however, since the 
likelihood of the ball being saved and then falling into the path of the
 attacking player is small. A particular tactic that can be used by the 
goalkeeper involves trying to distract the penalty taker by drawing his 
concentration away from striking the ball cleanly. Such tactics normally
 involve moving one's body, or body parts, in an extravagant manner, or 
through verbal comments. Famous examples of where this worked 
successfully include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Grobbelaar" title="Bruce Grobbelaar">Bruce Grobbelaar</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Cup_1983-84" title="European Cup 1983-84" class="mw-redirect">1984 European Cup final</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Dudek" title="Jerzy Dudek">Jerzy Dudek</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Champions_League_Final" title="2005 Champions League Final" class="mw-redirect">2005 Champions League Final</a>.</p>

<p>Some teams use forward defending, aggressively challenging the ball 
when on the defensive in any part of the field. Others rely on a 
"collapsing" style, that falls back deep into its own half when the 
opponent is in possession of the ball. The "forward" policy can put 
immense physical and psychological pressure on opponents, and is aimed 
at slowing down or breaking up attacks early. It has more physical 
demands however, and may spread a defensive formation more thinly. The 
"collapsing" approach is more economical in physical demand, and 
provides a packed back zone to thwart attacks. However it sometimes 
creates large gaps in midfield, and invites the opposing team to dribble
 forward and to take shots from long range; if the opposing team is good
 at the two aforementioned skills then goals will be conceded freely.</p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=31" title="Edit section: Defending with the ball">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Defending_with_the_ball">Defending with the ball</span></h4>
<p>Clearing is when the player in possession of the ball is pressed 
hard, often near his own goal, and chooses to shoot the ball away with 
low precision simply in order to get out of a dangerous situation. When 
opponent pressure is extremely high, the ball is often cleared to a 
corner kick or to a throw-in. Clearing long, but into opponent control, 
may give the defence time and the opportunity to organise, including 
setting up the correct formation and pressure height. If the attack was 
high up the field, such as in or near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area" title="Penalty area">penalty area</a>, defenders will thus quickly push out, and attackers will then be forced to retreat in order to avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_%28association_football%29" title="Offside (association football)">offside</a>
 in the next move. Clearing may be combined with an attempt to hit a 
long pass or a long through ball. Players high up in the field who are 
pressed hard, and who are eager to avoid a counter-attack, may in some 
instances combine clearing with a shot.</p>
<p>A team composed of good passers and mobile players with good 
positioning skills may more often try to avoid clearing, as their skills
 make it easier to make shorter passes and thus retaining possession 
until they get out of a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Retaining possession in this way may also be regarded as a 
longer-term way of defending, as the opposing team cannot attack when 
they don't have the ball. With the ball, the team applying this tactic 
can simply pass the ball between each other - as in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_tactics_and_skills#Possession_football" title="Football tactics and skills" class="mw-redirect">possession football</a> style, but with little or no intention of building up an attack, thus decreasing the risk of a break.</p>
<p>The major benefits of this tactic is that the team is in complete 
control over its opponents. Meanwhile, by knocking the ball around, 
opponents playing the pressing game can easily tire. And should an 
opportunity suddenly arise, defence may be quickly switched to attack. A
 major downfall is that because the accuracy of passes needs to be high,
 short passes between the players are required. This significantly 
narrows the gap between the attack, midfield and defence (usually, the 
latter is forced to push up). So if the opponent gains possession, a 
long ball could effectively open up the defence. Similarly, if it is the
 attack and midfield that need to drop back, the team will have little 
chances of counter-attacking even if possession is won back.</p>

<p><b>Beating a defence using width and depth.</b> Astute use of the principles of width and depth led to the final goal of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_FIFA_World_Cup" title="1970 FIFA World Cup">1970 World Cup</a>,
 considered by many to be the best combined team effort in Cup history. 
Almost all the players of Brazil touched the ball in this effort that 
penetrated one of the tightest defences ever seen, the famous Italian 
catenaccio "padlock" defence. The Italians used four defenders, plus a 
sweeper, Pierluigi Cera, behind the "back four". They relied on a 
counter-attacking game, deploying 3 midfielders, and 2 strikers, and 
closely marked opponents man to man.</p>
<p>This tight system however involved a "collapsing" approach that while
 packing the Italian penalty area and denying the Brazilian forwards 
much space, left relatively large gaps in midfield. See "Standing Off" 
defensive discussion above. Brazil's superb skills exploited this 
weakness, showing especially that any defence (whether man to man, zone 
or other variants) can be beaten using the principles of both width and 
depth. The weakness of the man to man system was also exposed. Italian 
left back Fachetti dedicated himself to winger Jairzinho, shadowing him 
tightly wherever he went. Jairzinho cunningly moved off the right flank,
 opening gaps for others to follow as can be seen below. See "Switching 
the attack" and "Swapping wing men" above for discussion of this aspect 
of offensive tactics.</p>
<div class="floatright"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Finalgoal4brazil70.jpg" class="image"><img alt="Finalgoal4brazil70.jpg" src="Association_football_tactics_and_skills_files/350px-Finalgoal4brazil70.jpg" height="403" width="350"></a></div>
<p><b>Italian defence pulled left in quick sequence.</b> Brazilian 
midfielder Clodoaldo began the move with a weaving dribble out to the 
left flank, that beat 3 men and essentially pulled the Italian defence 
in that direction. A fatal gap was thus eventually opened up for the run
 of fullback Carlos Alberto on the right. Clodoaldo eased the ball to 
the Rivelino moving up on the left. Rivelino quickly played the ball 
forward to Jairzinho, who crossed the field to appear on the left flank.</p>
<p><b>Movement in center "freezes" Italian defence.</b> Almost without 
pause the powerful Jairzinho began a weaving run. Fachetti played Jair 
well, backing off the ball, and squeezing him inside where it was more 
crowded. Good defenders will "channel" (see discussion above) an 
attacker into areas with less space. So far, all seemed safe for Italy. 
Fachetti covered well, as did the other Italian defenders. There were 2 
extra men as insurance in the back as Jairzinho began his run. Depth is 
also a principle of defence, and the sweeper system (or other 
arrangements) provides such.</p>
<p>As Jairzinho accelerated, the ever dangerous striker Tostao began a 
sprint up the middle, drawing his defender with him, diverting the 
Italian defence and making more room for Jairzinho. Younger players 
should note the movement off the ball by Brazil. Increasingly squeezed 
inside, Jairzinho's run nevertheless drew the defence to him and he 
eased the ball to Pele in the centre. Always dangerous, Pele paused and 
shaped to make a dribble.</p>
<p><b>Overlapping defender exploits principle of depth to cap the move.</b>
 For the Italian defence, there was still no cause for undue alarm. Pele
 seemed well covered, and there was still the sweeper at the back as 
insurance behind the defence. Nevertheless, Pele's feint, combined with 
the previous moves, kept Italian focus frozen in the middle, attracting 
the attention of three men, and he casually slipped the ball right- to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alberto_Torres" title="Carlos Alberto Torres">Carlos Alberto</a> who was thundering up from the rear, totally unmarked.</p>
<p>Pele played the ball well ahead of Alberto, using space 
intelligently, so that the fast fullback ran on and shot without 
pausing, in full stride, smashing the ball into the Italian net. So 
effective was Brazil's use of width, that no Italian defender is even 
within reasonable striking distance of Alberto until the last moment. 
The principle of width stretched and drew the Italian defence. The 
principle of depth—fresh men moving up from the rear—allowed Brazil to 
exploit the gaps created by width.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=34" title="Edit section: Penetration and envelopment in attack: Banks versus Pelé, Mexico 1970">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Penetration_and_envelopment_in_attack:_Banks_versus_Pel.C3.A9.2C_Mexico_1970">Penetration and envelopment in attack: Banks versus Pelé, Mexico 1970</span></h3>
<p><b>Penetration in attack- the forward or through pass:</b> To the 
footballer, the penetration pass is one of the first methods learned in 
attack, whether it be the simple "kick and chase" of the youth leagues, 
or the exquisite through-balls by today's world class stars. Penetration
 by pass is the quickest method of advancing the ball towards the enemy 
goal. When well executed, it can yield spectacular results. Penetration 
in attack however requires more than mere passing. Players without the 
ball must move into space, and must time their runs so as not to be 
caught offside.</p>
<p><b>Envelopment in attack: the central cross.</b> Attacking an 
opposing side from the flanks using crosses from the wings is among the 
oldest and most effective football tactics. An attack from the flanks 
uses width to stretch an opposing defence creating gaps in the goal area
 to be exploited. While the direction of the lateral cross is not as 
straightforward as the through-ball, both types of passes serve to split
 an enemy defence, in view of striking at the vital central area of the 
goal. This example, the legendary confrontation between keeper Gordon 
Banks of England and Pele of Brazil, captures the two types of attack in
 one snapshot. It also serves to illustrate the difficulties in 
defending against both types of passes.</p>
<p><b>Two pass types - one great defensive save.</b> The powerful running of Brazil's right winger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jairzinho" title="Jairzinho">Jairzinho</a>
 set the stage, with initial direction by captain Carlos Alberto. 
Sprinting down the flank, Jairzinho pounced on an excellent through pass
 from Alberto, accelerated past Cooper the English back, and lofted a 
high arcing cross to Pele in the centre. Pele headed down powerfully and
 was already raising his arms in triumph when Banks leaped to his right 
"like a salmon over a fall" Pele said later, and somehow flailed the 
bouncing ball over the crossbar, saving a sure goal. The Brazilian 
forward said it was the greatest save he had ever seen, and many would 
agree.</p>
<p>Offensively, this play demonstrates how both types of passes can 
divide and stretch a defence. Jairzinho's running and cross was set up 
by an excellent forward pass, and his centre to Pelé capped a move that 
should have resulted in a goal, were it not for the extraordinary skill 
of English keeper, Gordon Banks. Offside traps are one way to defend 
against both pass types, but the ultimate solution is defensive depth 
and sound goalkeeping.</p>

<p><b>Using the two-man combination.</b> The 2-man combination pass, 
variously called the wall pass, the "one-two", the "give and go" and 
other local names, is among the simplest yet most powerful team 
techniques in football. It requires a fair level of individual skill to 
pull off, yet this should not stop coaches from introducing it early in 
the higher youth leagues, nor should players from these leagues neglect 
it in favour of the all too easy "kick and chase". There are two ways to
 execute it: (a) pass and run to space for the return pass without 
pausing or (b) pass then pause briefly to gauge opposing reaction before
 running into an open spot for the return. In tight conditions, the 
first method is better, while the second can be used where there is a 
bit more space to operate.</p>

<p><b>Power of the two-man combination: Holland vs Brazil, 1974.</b> 
Simple as it is, the 2-man move can penetrate the teeth of the densest, 
most negative opposition. Peru brought it to a high art on the World Cup
 stage in 1970, under their coach <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdir_Pereira" title="Valdir Pereira">Didi</a>,
 Brazil's former midfield general of 1958 and 1962. Time after time 
Peruvian forwards like Cubillas, Gallardo, and Sotil put a central 
combination on the floor that sliced through the opposition and created 
countless dangerous situations. The Dutch team of 1974 were also 
disciples of the two-man combination. The diagram here shows the first 
Dutch goal in the 1974 game that crushed Brazil's repeat championship 
hopes - product of an exchange between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Neeskens" title="Johan Neeskens">Johan Neeskens</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff" title="Johan Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a>. This one actually worked. A two-man move also set up the second goal for Cruyff in the game. Contrast with the "hand" of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona" title="Diego Maradona">Diego Maradona</a> below.</p>
<p><b>Potential of the two-man combination: Maradona's "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_v_England_%281986_FIFA_World_Cup_quarter-final%29#.22Hand_of_God.22_goal" title="Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup quarter-final)">Hand of God</a>" goal – 1986.</b>
 The example shown below, the first goal of Diego Maradona against 
England in 1986, is used to illustrate the potential of the move. 
Argentina utilised it frequently, being ideally suited to their crisp, 
quick, short passing style. As he had often done during the game, 
Maradona initiated the sequence with a quick dribbling run into the 
packed central area. Surrounded, he began a 2-man combo pass - slipping 
the ball to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Valdano" title="Jorge Valdano">Jorge Valdano</a>
 on the right, and then moving up for the reply. Valdano pivoted and 
attempted to return, but conditions were too tight. Hodge, the English 
midfielder, intercepted and rather dangerously, attempted to tap the 
ball back to his keeper, Shilton. The rest is well known. Maradona and 
Shilton raced towards the floating ball, which connected with Maradona's
 hand (the so-called "Hand of God" goal), past Shilton, into the goal. 
While much controversy still surrounds the goal, Maradona's run 
illustrates how even the tightest conditions can be pried open with the 
two-man exchange. It also illustrates how the simple two-man combination
 can create countless dangerous situations and force opponents into 
making errors.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=36" title="Edit section: The three-man move">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_three-man_move">The three-man move</span></h3>
<p><b>Effectiveness of three-man strike teams.</b> The three-man move is
 another very effective weapon in the attacking arsenal. It is 
distinguished from simple passing between players in that the initiator 
of the move finishes it with a shot on goal or a well-placed pass 
leading to a shot. It is thus a collaboration of three distinct players.
 Famous three-man strike teams are legendary in football, from the 
earliest days, through the famous Hungarian sides of the 1950s, to the 
"clockwork orange" of the Dutch masters in the 1970s, through the 
German, Italian, French, Argentinian, Brazilian, and other teams of the 
contemporary era. The three-man package can be more effective than the 
two-man combo because it gives more attacking options and causes more 
confusion in the defence. The initial pass cannot be quickly cut off as 
in the two-man manoeuvre which really has only one option. Typically the
 second pass in the three-man move lures and diverts defenders on to 
false ground. This gives the initiator of the sequence time to run into 
an advantageous position. Triple player collaborations of course do not 
operate in isolation – they have other supporting players – but the 
tight three-man exchange still remains a fundamental pillar of 
successful attacking play.</p>
<p><b>Brazil vs Uruguay 1970 – strike package: Jairzinho – Pelé – Tostão.</b> The example below, is drawn from one of the most famous strike teams in World Cup history- Pelé, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tost%C3%A3o" title="Tostão">Tostão</a>
 and Jairzinho. This goal, against Uruguay in the 1970 semi-final, 
captures the power of the move. The fast winger Jairzinho set the stage-
 dribbling down the right flank before finding Pelé ahead. Tightly 
marked, and with his back to the goal, Pelé immediately played a subtle 
pass to Tostão. The Brazilian center-forward drew the defence to him 
with a short dribble before finding Jairzinho again on the wing. This 
exchange of passes gave Jairzinho a lead on other defenders and he made 
the most of it – accelerating down the wing, selling a dummy (letting 
the ball run after pretending to stop and play it) on Uruguayan defender
 Matosas, and muscling him aside as he approached the enemy goal. 
Uruguayan keeper Mazurkiewicz came off his line but it was simply too 
late, as Jairzinho slotted the ball into the net. Of note in this 
sequence is the attacking space created by the tight exchanges between 
Jairzinho, Pelé, and Tostão. Even the Uruguayans, playing one of the 
most densely packed, negative defences seen in a World Cup could not 
stop it. Jairzinho is surrounded by opposing defenders when the sequence
 starts, but at the end, he only has one to deal with. Also of note is 
the unselfish passing of Brazilian striker Tostão, with his skill 
creating countless openings for his teammates throughout the 1970 
tournament.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The quick counter-attack requires intelligent running, exhaustive 
physical effort and good passing and dribbling skill. The diagram below 
shows a classic counter-attack in the epic 1970, World Cup game—England 
versus Germany. Two passes, separated by a brief dribble yielded a goal.
 English midfielder Alan Mullery started the move at almost the centre 
of the field with a crucial pass, floating a long ball over three 
Germans, out to the right flank.</p>
<p>It was collected by Newton, a defender moving up form a deep 
position, and it quickly put him in excellent attacking position with 
few opponents to check his progress. Newton advanced on a short dribble,
 before producing a low, outstanding diagonal cross that found Mullery 
who had sprinted into the goalmouth. Mullery finished what he had 
started, by ramming the ball home past the German keeper Maier. 
Tactically this goal combines the power of the long pass with that of 
the two-man combination, and indeed, before his pass to Newton, Mullery 
had exchanged passes with Francis Lee before setting off on his final 
combination run.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_football_tactics_and_skills&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38" title="Edit section: Free-kicks and set-pieces">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Free-kicks_and_set-pieces">Free-kicks and set-pieces</span></h3>
<p><b>Indirect free-kicks</b> can throw a defence into confusion when 
taken quickly, or in unexpected directions. The third goal of Brazil's 
1970 World Cup victory over Italy illustrates the method. Brazil's 
midfield general Gerson Nunes approached rapidly and lofted the dead 
ball in a high arc almost from the midfield line. It found Pele 
perfectly positioned near the Italian goal. The Brazilian headed down 
softly and accurately, straight into the path of the onrushing winger 
Jairzinho, who virtually walked the ball into the net. Italy's <i>catenaccio</i>
 defence was caught out of position here, not only failing to neutralise
 Pele, but providing little cover to stop Jairzinho. A rapid, daring 
set-piece kick will often accomplish this unbalancing of defences.</p>
<p><b>Direct free-kicks</b> are a key part of attacking in football, and
 can lead to many goals. Numerous feints and ruses are tried to fool the
 opposition, including having attackers join the "wall." A successful 
free kick from the 1970 World Cup- Brazil vs Czechoslovakia, illustrates
 how the technique works. Brazilian forwards Jairzinho and Tostao 
cunningly joined the end of the defensive wall as the Czechs set it up. 
As Pele backed off and feinted as if to take the kick, both Jair and 
Tostao began to move off, creating space. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Rivelino" title="Roberto Rivelino">Roberto Rivelino</a> ghosted in from the side to shoot powerfully into the gap for a goal.</p>

An example of diagonal movement in attack</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Moving into free space is one of the most critical skills that 
footballers must develop. Standing around to admire one's handiwork is 
unproductive effort. Attacking players must move <i>off the ball</i> 
into space to give an advance the maximum chance of success. Passes to 
space are feasible when there is intelligent movement of players to 
receive the ball and do something constructive with it. All the great 
players show an ability to find open gaps and seams in a defence- 
positioning themselves to receive a pass. Smart use of space also causes
 confusion in a defence as multiple attacking options throw opponents 
off balance.</p>
<p>The diagram shown illustrates a very productive use of movement off 
the ball into space at the World Cup level, leading to a goal. 
Midfielder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Bonhof" title="Rainer Bonhof">Rainer Bonhof</a>
 made a long diagonal run out to the right side of the field, that put 
him clear of the Dutch opposition. He was quickly found by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Grabowski" title="Jürgen Grabowski">Jürgen Grabowski</a>, and Bonhof ran on untouched deep into the Dutch half, building up speed. He beat Dutch defender <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arie_Haan" title="Arie Haan">Arie Haan</a> and centred to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_M%C3%BCller" title="Gerd Müller">Gerd Müller</a>,
 who pounced on the cross to slam it home for the German victory. Moving
 diagonally is one of the best offensive movements, whether at the near 
or far posts, or out to the wings further back in midfield. Diagonal 
movement creates added space to manoeuvre, compared to simply running 
straight ahead.</p>

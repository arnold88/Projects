<h2><a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/%7Ei340/">CS 340 - Software Design</a></h2>
<h3>Machine Problem 5, Spring 2010</h3>
<h3>Mancala Part 2 - Networks</h3>
<h3>Due: Thursday, April 27, 2010 at 11:59 pm</h3>
<p>
For this project, every CS undergraduate student must work 
on a team of either 2 or 3 people.  Those students who
are not CS undergraduate students may work on the project
by themselves or in a group of 2 or 4 people.
</p><p>
For this project, you are to take the Mancala projgram from
Project 4 and create a networked version of the game.
</p><p>
This project must make use of a menu.  Items in the
menu must include:
</p><ul>
<li>An About Menu Item - this will display a window/dialog
box with information about the development team and the product.
<p>
</p></li><li>A Help Menu Item - this will display information about how
to play mancala.
<p>
</p></li><li>A Top Scores Menu Item - this will display a window/dialog box
with information for (at least) the name of the winners of the
5 best scores encountered by the program.  When a top score
is encountered, prompt the winner for a name to be saved by the
program.
<p>
</p></li><li>Game Play Mode Menu Items
<p>
This game has two playing modes.  The first is a single
screen two player game (i.e. what was created for project  4).
The second in a client/server version of the game.
</p><p>
For the client/server version, the user is to select whether
they will be the client or the server.  It is assumed that
the server is on a "well known ip address and port" so the
client just knows what information to use to conntect to 
the server.  The client will be prompted to enter in this
information to the program.
</p><p>

<h3>Below is the original Write-up for this project</h3>
<p>
For this project you are to implement a GUI two person 
version of the game 
<a href="http://www.aflcio.org/unionshop/games/game_mancala.cfm">
Mancala</a> (note: I have no idea why the game is on the web site
for the AFL-CIO.)  Since the game of mancala does seem to have
many variations, we will use the information supplied
by this web page as the "official rules" for mancala.  The rules
on that page reflect the most common rules for the game and
the discussion of the game below (are intended to) follow
those rules.
</p><p>
The game for Mancala consists of 2 "mancalas", 12 cups
and 48 stones.  Each player has control of 1 mancala and
6 cups.  The game board is laid out as follows:
</p><blockquote>
<table border="2">
<tbody><tr>
<th rowspan="2" bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Mancala
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #1
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #2
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #3
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #4
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #5
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #6
</th><th rowspan="2" bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Mancala
</th></tr><tr>
<th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #6
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #5
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #4
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #3
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #2
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #1
</th></tr></tbody></table>
</blockquote>
The game is started with have 4 "stones" in each of
the 12 cups. 
Thus the board will look as follows when the game starts:
<blockquote>
<table border="2">
<tbody><tr>
<th rowspan="2" bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Mancala<br>0 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #1<br>4 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #2<br>4 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #3<br>4 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #4<br>4 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #5<br>4 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #6<br>4 Stones
</th><th rowspan="2" bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Mancala<br>0 Stones
</th></tr><tr>
<th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #6<br>4 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #5<br>4 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #4<br>4 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #3<br>4 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #2<br>4 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #1<br>4 Stones
</th></tr></tbody></table>
</blockquote>
The goal of the game is to get more
stones into your own mancala than the other player
can get into his/her mancala by the end of the game.
It is possible to end the game in a tie.  This is when both
players have 24 stones in their mancalas a the end of 
the game.
<p>
On a player's turn, the player selects one of his cups
that has one or more stones in it.  All of the stones in
that cup are removed and they are placed one-by-one going
counter-clockwise around the board into the cups or
the players own mancala.  A player never places a stone
into the other player's mancala.
</p><p>
Assume that a player has 12 stones in cup #3.
If the player were to select that cup on his/her turn,
the player would then:
</p><ol>
<li>place one stone in his/her cup #2
</li><li>place one stone in his/her cup #1
</li><li>place one stone in his/her own mancala
</li><li>place one stone in the oppenent's cup #6
</li><li>place one stone in the oppenent's cup #5
</li><li>place one stone in the oppenent's cup #4
</li><li>place one stone in the oppenent's cup #3
</li><li>place one stone in the oppenent's cup #2
</li><li>place one stone in the oppenent's cup #1
</li><li>place one stone in his/her cup #6
</li><li>place one stone in his/her cup #5
</li></ol>
<p>
There are two special cases that occur when the
last stone from a cup is placed.
</p><ol>
<li>If the last stone from a cup gets placed into
the player's mancala, the player gets another turn.
<p>
</p></li><li>If the last stone from a cup gets placed into
one of the player's own cups that is empty and the
opponent's cup directly across from that empty cup
is not empty, the player then captures all of the
stones in opponent's cup plus the one stone placed
in the player's own cup.  All of the captured stones
are then placed directly into the player's own mancala.
<p>
For example assume the board is as shown below and it is Player
1's turn:
<table border="2">
<tbody><tr>
<th rowspan="2" bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Mancala<br>18 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #1<br>1 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #2<br>1 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #3<br>0 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #4<br>5 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #5<br>1 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="yellow">Player 2<br>Cup #6<br>0 Stones
</th><th rowspan="2" bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Mancala<br>14 Stones
</th></tr><tr>
<th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #6<br>3 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #5<br>1 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #4<br>0 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #3<br>0 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #2<br>2 Stones
</th><th bgcolor="pink">Player 1<br>Cup #1<br>2 Stones
</th></tr></tbody></table>
If Player 1 selected Cup #6, the last stone would
end up in his/her Cup #3 (which is empty)
and a capture would occur.
The 5 stones in Player 2's Cup #4 plus the last stone
which ended up in Player 1's Cup #3 would all be placed
into Player 1's mancala.
</p><p>
If Player 1 had selected Cup #5, the last stone would
have ended up in his/her Cup #4 (which was empty).  A capture would not
have occurred since Player 2's Cup #3 was also empty.
</p><p>
If player 1 had selected Cup #1, the last stone would have ended
up in an empty cup, but no capture would occur since it was
Player 2's empty cup.
</p></li></ol>
<p>
The game is over when all of the cups of one of the two players
have no stones in them at the end of the player's turn.  Any
stones left in the other player's cups are immediately moved
to that player's mancala.

</p><h3>Comments and Submission for Project 5</h3>
Your program must be written in good programming style. This includes 
(but is not limited to) meaningful identifier names, a file header at 
the beginning of each source code file, a function header at the beginning 
of the function, proper use of blank lines and indentation to aide 
in the reading of your code, explanatory "value-added" in-line 
comments, etc.
<p>
The work you turn in must be 100% developed by your own team. 
You are not allowed to 
share code with any other person (inside this class or not). You 
may discuss the project with other persons; however, you may not 
show any code you write to any other person outside of your team
nor may you look at any 
other person's written code.
</p><p>
You are to submit this project using the CS Department's UNIX machine's 
turnin command. The project name for this assignment is proj5. Be sure 
to submit all source code, header files, makefile as well as your program 
description. Failure to turnin all required pieces will result in a lower 
grade for the assignment.

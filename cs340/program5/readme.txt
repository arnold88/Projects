Game rules:

The goal of the game is to get more stones into your own mancala than the other player can get into his/her mancala by the end of the game. It is possible to end the game in a tie. This is when both players have 24 stones in their mancalas a the end of the game.

The game will always start with Player 1's turn. Player 1's cups -- represented by a LCD display -- are located in the bottom half while Player 2's cup are the upper half. Player 1's mancala is located on the right of the board, while Player 2's on the left.

The middle space is the status message box, it displays message such as whose turn it is now (player 1's turn or player 2's turn), the game is over, or if special evens occured (FREE TURN or BONUS, explained below).

On a player's turn, the player selects one of his cups by hitting the "NUDGE" button that has one or more stones in it. All of the stones in that cup are removed and they are placed one-by-one going counter-clockwise around the board into the cups or the players own mancala. A player never places a stone into the other player's mancala. 

Assume that a player has 12 stones in cup #3. If the player were to select that cup on his/her turn, the player would then:

   1. place one stone in his/her cup #2
   2. place one stone in his/her cup #1
   3. place one stone in his/her own mancala
   4. place one stone in the oppenent's cup #6
   5. place one stone in the oppenent's cup #5
   6. place one stone in the oppenent's cup #4
   7. place one stone in the oppenent's cup #3
   8. place one stone in the oppenent's cup #2
   9. place one stone in the oppenent's cup #1
  10. place one stone in his/her cup #6
  11. place one stone in his/her cup #5 

There are two special cases that occur when the last stone from a cup is placed.

   1. If the last stone from a cup gets placed into the player's own mancala, the player gets another turn. The status message box in the middle will say "Player 1 (or player 2) FREE TURN".

   2. If the last stone from a cup gets placed into one of the player's own cups that is empty and the opponent's cup directly across from that empty cup is not empty, the player then captures all of the stones in opponent's cup plus the one stone placed in the player's own cup. All of the captured stones are then placed directly into the player's own mancala. When this occurs, The statuse message box will say "Player 1 (or player 2) collected BONUS". 

The game is over when all of the cups of one of the two players have no stones in them at the end of the player's turn. Any stones left in the other player's cups are immediately moved to that player's mancala. The status message box will display "GAME OVER" and will declare a winner or "DRAW" if a tie occurs.

At any point in the game or after the game is over, press the "RESET" button in the bottom to start over again.

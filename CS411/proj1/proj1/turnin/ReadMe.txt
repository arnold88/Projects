This zip file includes:

Readme.txt - this file
makefile - UNIX make file
puzzle.h - puzzle header file
puzzle.cpp - puzzle implementation
proj1.cpp - main program

How to compile:

In UNIX: copy all files including the make file, and type "make" at the prompt of the folder.

In Windows (VS 2010): Uncomment "#include <stdafx.h>" on all source files, and build the program.

The output will be either ./proj1 (UNIX) or proj1.exe

The program will automatically look for "input.txt" from the same directory for the input file.

The program will write all directions to the file in "output.txt" from the source code directory.

The included excel file "report.xls" contains the report for BFS and DFS search performances.

Have fun!
